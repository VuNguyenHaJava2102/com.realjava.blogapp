    /*
    In Spring Framework, Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. When youâ€™re
    working with a remote interface, each call is expensive. As a result, you need to reduce the number of calls.
    The solution is to create a Data Transfer Object that can hold all the data for the call. It needs to be
    serializable to go across the connection
